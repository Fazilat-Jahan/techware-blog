    title: 'AI Won’t Eat Your Job Until.',
    slug: 'ai-will-not-eat-your-job-until',
    category: "trending",
    content: `AI has been on the rise, so people have started thinking about their job security with it, in many industries. But before we start imagining a grim future where machines rule the workforce, it’s important to note that, at least for now, AI is not really going to eat up your job. Here’s why.`,
    heading1: `1. Until You Stop Developing Your Skills`,
    heading1C: `Although AI works very well on a lot of data, it tends to lack creativity, emotional intelligence, and solving complex problems. So jobs based on those fundamentally human characteristics remain safe — provided you keep working on them.In fact, a World Economic Forum report holds that by 2025, 50% of all employees will need reskilling. Those who adapt will find that AI can complement rather than replace their roles.`,
    heading2: `2. Until Your Job Becomes Entirely Predictable`,
    heading2C: `AI is effective in such environments where work is repetitive and very predictable. For instance, if you think of it this way, maybe data entry or basic analytics could be done quite easily. But in fields where the work fluctuates a lot and one has to adapt the thinking to the circumstances on the fly — such as strategic marketing or creative arts — AI doesn’t find its place. The trick is to ensure your role remains fluid and unpredictable.`,
    heading3: `3. Until You Start to Get Complacent`,
    heading3C: `The greatest threat AI poses is to those who become complacent. If you’re not actively improving or diversifying your skill set, you risk becoming obsolete. AI is a tool, and like any other tool, it’s useful only in the hands of the wielder. Embrace lifelong learning in order to stay ahead.`,
    conclusion: `AI is not here to take your job but rather to make your job better. The moment you stop evolving, the instant you make it easy for your job to be predictable, the instant you miss this human touch is when AI might start edging closer. But if you remain adaptable, creative, and proactive, AI will be your ally — not your adversary.`,
